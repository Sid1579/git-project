Version control is essential in collaborative projects as it allows multiple team members to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes. It keeps track of every modification made to the project, enabling easy access to previous versions. This transparency helps in identifying who made specific changes and why, fostering accountability and facilitating better collaboration. Moreover, version control systems like Git allow for branching, enabling developers to experiment with new features in isolation before merging them into the main codebase. This significantly reduces the risk of introducing bugs and promotes a more organized workflow.
